        Old-school hip hop is noted for its relatively simple rapping techniques, compared to later hip hop music.  Artists such as Melle Mel would use few syllables per bar of music,with simple rhythms  and a moderate tempo.<br>

Much of the subject matter of old-school hip hop centers around partying and having a good time. In the book How to Rap, Immortal Technique explains how party content played a big part in old-school hip hop: "hip-hop was born in an era of social turmoil... in the same way that slaves used to sing songs on a plantation... that's the party songs that we used to have".<br>
Old-school hip hop typically refers to music created around 1979, however, the term may also be applied to music before this with hip-hop styles. "Here Comes the Judge" (1968) by Pigmeat Markham is often referred to as "old-school hip hop"<br>
